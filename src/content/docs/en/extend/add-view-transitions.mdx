**View transitions** are a way to control what happens when visitors navigate between pages on your site. Astro's View Transitions API allows you to add optional navigation features including smooth page transitions and animations, controling the brower's history stack of visited pages and preventing full-page refreshes in order to persist some page elements and state while updating the content displayed.

## Prerequisites

You will need **an existing Astro project with a common base layout or `<Head />` component**.

This tutorial uses the [Build a Blog tutorial's finished project](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo) to demonstrate adding view transitions (client-side routing) to an existing Astro project. You can fork and use that codebase locally, or complete the tutorial in the browser by [editing the blog tutorial's code in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro).

You can instead follow similar steps in your own Astro project, but you will need to adjust the instructions for your own codebase. We recommend using our sample project to complete this short tutorial first. Then, you can use what you have learned to work on your own codebase.

## Build a Blog Tutorial Code

In the Build a Blog introductory tutorial, you learned about Astro's [built-in file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/#static-routes): any `.astro` or `.md` file anywhere within the `src/pages/` folder automatically became a new page on your site.

To navigate between these pages, you used the standard HTML `<a>` element. For example, to create a link to your About page, you added `<a href="/about/">About</a>` to your page header. When a visitor to your site clicked that link, the browser refreshed and loaded a new page with entirely new content.

## Full-page navigation vs client-side routing (SPA mode)

When a browser refreshes and loads a new page, there is no continuity between the old page and the new page. During client-side routing, a new page is displayed without a full-page browser refresh. Client-side routing is a feature of single-page application (SPA) sites, where your entire site is essentially "one page" of JavaScript whose content is updated based on visitor interaction.

Client-side routing allows you to control page transitions in several ways. Persistent elements, such as a common page header, do not have to be entirely rerendered on the screen and the transition from one page to another can appear much smoother. You can add animations to matching elements on the old and new page, so that new content slides or fades in or out of the page.

There are times when you will want or need a full-page browser refresh. For example, when a link takes a visitor to a `.pdf` document, you will need the browser to load that new page from the server. Even with view transitions enabled in your Astro project, you will be able to specify how the browser should navigate both by default and on a per-link basis, even opting out of client-side routing entirely.

Read more about [Astro's view transitions](/en/guides/view-transitions/) in our guide, or get started with the instructions below to convert a basic blog from `src/pages/posts/` to `src/content/posts/`.

## Extending the blog tutorial with view transitions

The steps below show you how to extend the final product of the Build a Blog tutorial by adding client-side routing to enhance page transitions.

### Upgrade dependencies

1. Upgrade to the latest version of Astro, and upgrade all integrations to their latest versions by running the following commands in your terminal:

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      # Upgrade to Astro v3.x
      npm install astro@latest

      # Example: upgrade the blog tutorial Preact integration
      npm install @astrojs/preact@latest
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      # Upgrade to Astro v3.x
      pnpm install astro@latest

    # Example: upgrade the blog tutorial Preact integration
      pnpm install @astrojs/preact@latest
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      # Upgrade to Astro v3.x
      yarn add astro@latest

    # Example: upgrade the blog tutorial Preact integration
      yarn add @astrojs/preact@latest
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

    :::tip
    If you are using your own project, then be sure to update any dependencies you have installed. The example blog tutorial codebase only uses the Preact integration.

### Add the `<ViewTransitions />` router

2. Import and add the `<ViewTransitions />` component to the `<head>` of your page layout. 

    In the Blog tutorial example, the `<head>` element is found in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. The `ViewTransitions` router must be first imported into the component's frontmatter. Then, add the routing component inside the `<head>` element.

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro" ins={2,15}
    ---
    import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
    import Header from "../components/Header.astro";
    import Footer from "../components/Footer.astro";
    import "../styles/global.css";
    const { pageTitle } = Astro.props;
    ---
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>{pageTitle}</title>
        <ViewTransitions />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Header />
        <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
        <slot />
        <Footer />
        <script>
          import "../scripts/menu.js";
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    No other configuration is necessary to enable Astro's default client-side navigation! Astro will create default page animations based on the similarities between the old and new page, and will also provide fallback behavior for unsupported browsers.

3. Navigate between pages in your site preview

    As you move between pages on your site, notice that the old page content appears to fade out as the new page content fades in. You can now add custom behavior to control individual page links if you are not satisfied with the defaults.
